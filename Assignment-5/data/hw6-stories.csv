"There once was a crow.  The crow was sitting on a branch of a tree.  Some cheese was in the beak of the crow.  
A fox observed the crow and tried to discover how to get the cheese.  
The fox came and stood under the tree.  
The fox looked toward the crow and said that he saw a noble bird who was above him.  
The fox said that the beauty of the bird was incomparable.  
The fox said that the hue of the plumage of the bird was exquisite.  
The fox said that -- if the sweetness of the voice of the bird is equal to the fairness of the appearance of the bird -- the bird would be undoubtedly the queen of every bird.  
The crow felt that the fox had flattered her and cawed loudly in order for she to show him that she was able to sing.  
The cheese fell.  
The fox snatched the cheese, said that the crow was able to sing and the fox said that the crow needed wits.

","A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. 
Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, ""What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."" 
The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, ""You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."""

"There once was a fat bull.  The bull was grazing in a meadow.  
A lion watched the bull and salivated because the lion wanted to eat the bull.  
The lion didn't attack the bull because the lion feared sharp every horn of the bull.  
The lion began to be hungry and decided to attempt to kill the bull.  
The lion planned to trick the bull because the lion wasn't able to fight the bull.  
The lion walked toward the bull and began to feign that the lion was friendly.  
The lion said to the bull that the lion admired the body of the bull, admired the head of the bull, he admired every shoulder of the bull and admired every thigh of the bull.  
The lion advised the bull to remove every horn of the bull because every horn of the bull was ugly.  
The lion succeeded in persuading the bull to remove every horn of the bull.  
The lion ate the bull, and the bull began to be defenseless.

","A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns.
Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.
Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, ""I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure.  What a fine head!  What powerful shoulders and thighs!  But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns?  You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly.  Believe me, you would do much better without them.""
The Bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defense, fell an easy prey to the Lion."

",Today was a very eventful work day. Today was the start of the G20 summit. It happens every year and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their governments effectively and what not. Since there are so many leaders coming together their are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest. There was a protest that happened along the street where I work and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot. Police cars were burned and things were thrown at cops. Police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence. As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters while they smash windows of stores. And this all happened right in front of my store which was kind of scary but it was kind of interesting since I've never seen a riot before.
