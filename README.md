## Assignment-1 Folder:

In this folder, this is just an assignment given my NLP course at University of California, Santa Cruz. The purpose of this assignment is to understand the NLTK tool using python. Here are short summary of what I learned in this assignment.

- NLTK Frequency Distribution
- Sentence and word tokenizer
- Part of Speech tagger
- Callocation and tabulate function

## Assignment-2 Folder:

In this folder, this is a second assignment given my NLP course at University of California, Santa Cruz. The purpose of this assignment is to understand more functions of NLTK tools.

## Assignment-3 Folder:

This is the most exciting assignment I learned to use Naive Bayes Classification. I learned to use classifier and train the data. Data, in this assignment, was restaurant reviews. Using these reviews, I was able to predict whether the comment is negative or positive. The given default trained data gave me around 56% accuracy. The highest I got was 62%.

## Assignment-4 Folder;

In this assignment, I managed to use tools from open source such as scikit-learn, and Google dictionary. Through these tools, I predicted the restaurant reviews binary classification using Supprt Vector Machine (SVM), word embedding, and binary tree classification.
