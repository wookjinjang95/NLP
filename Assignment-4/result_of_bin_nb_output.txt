Great food. We went at a slow time so I think we got extra attention. Good prices. We shared the blackened chicken, crab cakes, and vodoo crawfish, everything was excellent. I will definitely go again.

Excellent dining experience. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, the service was great, and, it was positively the freshest sushi we have ever had. The food melts in your mouth and we wished we could eat more. The presentation of the sushi we ordered was so beautiful we almost didn't want to eat it. We will be going back again very soon.

Lorenzo's has the best homemade Italian food on the south shore. I have been going there for almost 30 years. I remember going there as a kid and having pizza and soda brought out by a waitress on roller skates. I just love their homemade pasta. Their portion size is just right and for a family of 5 you can have a great meal for under $100. I tell all my friends and family to go there and many of them are hooked, even the ones out of state.

"Star" is not much to look at, and it's loud and busy, but you come here for the sensational food. You can also do take-out and avoid crowds at dinner time. Delicious thin crust pizza, and the best baked ziti and linquini w/ clam sauce I've ever eaten.

When we first arrived we where sceptical because the place was so bussy. but from the time we were seated, which was about 15 minutes after our reservation time, to our desswrt we where treated great and the waiter was personable, and the food was to die for. We where very happy and we would return.

The Black Bear Diner is like no other diner, you can tell from the moment you enter the restaurant and see the cool bear theme. The menus are printed on a 1927 edition of a newspaper apparently sponsored by the Carmel Pine Cone, a local newspaper which is owned by a couple of close personal friends of mine, Paul Miller and Kirstie Wilde. The Black Bear philosophy has six credos, number 4 states: "If you don't say. "WOW", when your food arrives, you either ordered toast, or my chef had a flashback to the days when they were working somewhere else" (I paraphrased that). To tell you the truth, I had no intention of saying "Wow", when my food arrived, but guess what, I did!! I had no choice, The Black Bear Diner offers such large portions. They don't skimp on the portions or the flavor, there was no doggie bag needed, at least, in my case I cleaned my plate. The Black Bear Diner serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, now that I know about the Black Dear Diner, I shall return.

We've now eaten at the Homestead maybe five times. It is totally surprising to find a restaurant of this quality in Huntsville. You would expect something this fine in Houston, but Huntsville? Everything we've tried has been fantastic. Do not come if you are in a big rush, but this is the perfect way to spend a relaxing evening of dining. They will never try to rush you or hurry you along. It's a great place to eat, drink, and talk with friends.

We had a great experience in this Thai restaurant. The menu had many items, and the service very efficient despite the many customers having lunch on a weekday. This restaurant has an air of authenticity that's very pleasant, and finally the food is... delicious!

I have been going to Riccardo's Pizza since I moved to Browns Mills in 1989 and we all love it! Vito and his staff always makes the family feel welcome and ALWAYS makes my kids smile while waiting for our food. I think the sauce is the best in town, and I am very picky about my sauce. The prices are great, the business is always clean, and the service is prompt and courteous. Very enjoyable...Perfecto Vito!

I don't share the opinion of the previous review of this restaurant. I am a very picky eater and I have dined here numerous of times, never having had a bad experience. Maybe I am lucky and the previous reviewer is continually unlucky. Or maybe the reviewer is just too good for this simple diner. The Silver Spoon has always been clean, and the staff has always been happy and very on-the-ball with service. Someone shaving in the bathroom is odd, but can the restaurant really control that? Did the reviewer inform the management and if so, did the management correct the problem? The decor is VERY 1970's, maybe even older, but that is apart of the diner's charm. Where has Rip Taylor and Shelley Winters been all these years? Here at the Silver Spoon. I've seen them here many times, and they are just nonchalant diners eating diner food. There is no pretention here. Just a simple diner. During weekend brunchs, many of the local homosexuals gather here like flocks of flamingoes while nursing hangovers from the previous night. I think this just adds to the character of the restaurant. Who needs Dulce or Spago anyway? As a simple, high maintenance diner I prefer the Silver Spoon.

This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cherry Hill area. Great fajitas and chimichangas. If you get a strawberry margarita, ask for a middle shelf or top shelf brand. The house brand isn't very good. My girlfriend says they have a great corn chowder soup and great cilantro salad dressing. Also, try the quesadilla appetizer.

Such fun! Food ok. Not great, not bad. But, place is a joy, corney and entertaining. Great value for the money spent.

Very good place, somewhat costly unless you take into consideration all the service that comes with it!

sorry...not enought time... to spend there...not enought time to try all the wonderful dishes in the Bonadies' restaurant (we really had to walk for an hour long after our dinner). The owner of the hotel is a delicious man and he let us try quite all the menu-choise..)...not enought time to relax on that relaxing terrace with stunning view over the coast. Well, we went round for "normal visiting" and the girls at the desk where so helpfull in arranging transportation, but our dailydream was to go back soon in our hotel. One week is not enought, the people is really something. All very smiling, seem to be happy to be involved in such a big plan to make us happy anytime. We discovered they also have an International Management Certification and a Citation from the Office of the President -Borough of Brooklin- and a certificate from Brooklin Restaurant Association. Well done!!! go ahead this way, we will be back soon

What a pleasant evening in Chicago! I ordered the 16 Oz Prime Rib which was delicious!! I couldn't even eat it all. The baked potato was awesome too. Staff is really friendly! Would return!

My date and I decided to travel to the jersey shore and we stumled upon Riccardo's Pizza and Italian Eatery. Upon our entry we walked through a pizza area. We took notice of what we thought was a pizzeria . WOW were we mistaken. When we walked into the dining roon we noticed granite floors and marble walls. The side walls were all done in murals done by a local artist depicting a Sicilian setting. There was also a Authentic espresso and cappuccino bar along with allll! the Torani syrups for the coffees! (The owner went to great lenghts to decorate this place). We ordered from the Chef's Specials and our waiter was very good and well informed. We asked to speak to the chef and he came out immedietly. Althogh very busy he came out of the kitchen looking more like an actor or model than a chef . He had an arroagant look but was very cherming and answered all our questions. We orderd thecollasal shrimp ala Vito (the chef's name and the veal wich was stuffed with lobster and crabmeat both were excellent!!!!! What can i say so was dessert wich is made homemade!! So next time your in Browns Mills and driving to the shore or at the N.J cranberry festival make sure to stop by Riccardo's ....you'll be surprised at the incredible food and possibly one of the best chef's and best kept secret in NJ!!!!!!! BUON APETITO!!

We have eaten at a lot of restaurants in our time, but Vito definately serves the best! We love the garlic knots, the rice balls, and everything that we have tried on the menu. The wait staff is excellent, courteous, and Vito somehow always manages to find a singing head waiter. From the outside, Riccardo's gives the impression of being another pizzeria but inside, it is an adventure in fine dining. In my husband's work, he speaks to people from all over the country but when he finds someone from NJ, he always recommends Riccardo's. Vito always manages to visit with his customers, asking where they are from, have they been there before, and give the personal touch that other establishments don't offer. Riccardo's is definately a place not to be passed by!

We go here pretty often since it is pretty close by, plus we love our sushi chef "Eddie" - we secretly call him Eddie the Lover. lol Their sushi tastes really good and the taste and service is very consistent. I usually order the seaweed salad, unagi roll, baked green mussel and hot green tea, plus an iced tea. By the time I am finished with my meal my green tea is cool enough for me to sip. My fiance, Marc, is not a big sushi eater and only gets two spider rolls and a coke - every time. His palate is not very adventurous. The prices are very good and the staff very friendly, as I have found most sushi bars to be. The sushi bar is quite large btw. The average meal for us is about $40. but I am a pig. I once split a bottle of cold ginger-flavored sake ($15.00) with Eddie, and it took me by surprise how strong it was. I exclaimed, I can't feel my face!! and told him he was trying to get me drunk. lol If you ever go and sit at the bar, ask for Eddie and he will take really good care of you and keep you laughing.

Our dinner had the possibility of being disasterous. VERY BUSY time, needed to send food back due to allergies (we didn't ask what was in the dish). They not only brought out another dish, but comped it AND gave us THREE free deserts for the table. Incredible staff and managment.

Rude employees. Bartenders are the worst. An extremely local hang-out. If not a friend of the crew, be prepared to wait, and no friendly attitudes. Bar top a mess, and always wet. Best thing is the T.V's showing sports. Live music there is o.k, not great. Some nice decor, and there are pool tables with room to play. More for the just turning 21 crowd.

Stay out of this dump ! It's filthy and shouldn't be allowed to serve food.The washrooms should be condemed.They have springs on the taps,if your brave enough to touch them.The bakery is hidden in the basement.We had breakfast I had the omlette which was stuffed with unidentifyable things.The coffee was extra and so was the butter .The doggie bag came in handy because I skipped desert and went straight to the the hospital.

I am a vegan and there was nothing on the menu for me but pizza, hold the cheese. Nice atmosphere though.

Good service but food was not so great. If you ask me, I prefer better food for the price.
