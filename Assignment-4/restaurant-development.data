Text = "I would like to think that if you were to go out for dinner that you would not be insulted by the server. We had a rude server who insulted us from the first minute we walked in. We were asked to move from the front door and then asked to move from by the bar. The restaurant was busy but the way we were talked to was what we took offence to. We received our drinks, 20 minutes after we ordered them. We asked the server what was taking so long and she snapped at us, telling us that she was busy and that was the way Bin does things around here. We ordered a few tapas. Should have been called CRAPAS. The food took forever and came in 30 min intervals. The blonde cook was angry and was drinking on the job!!!! Should have put more effort into the food instead of into his drinking. They screwed up our order twice and then managed to charge us for things that we did not even eat. We were told that Bin was good - we would have to say that Bin is S...! What a crime...don't eat here. Food is a rip off and service was horrible. I phoned to complain but doubt if they will do anything about it. There is a better restaurant one block down...we will go there from now on!!!"

Text = "Too bad this site does not offer a negative rating. The entire table chose to order the buffet. The buffet was nearly empty of food and the lighting was horrible. I am not exaggerating to say that you could barely see the food in the trays. The food itself was abyssmal. Greasy, greasy,greasy. The rice was as tough as gristle. The waitress was very unpleasant and inattentive. The restaurant was not busy, so there was no excuse for the poor service. I specifically got up from the table and went to find a waitress to take our drink order, or to at least have our waitress come to take the order, and then was told by the manager that the woman I had spoke with wasn't our waitress. That does not matter. Good staffing knows that you just say okay and send someone to take the order. When the waitress did come she was very flippant with the table and sloshed the drinks. After complaining to the owner about the food and the service and how we would not be back because of both, he not only did not apologize or offer to take anything off the bill but said that was our choice. An absolutely horrible dining experience which was just a shame because we had went there to celebrate one of our birthdays. I have lived in Morgantown 16 years and dined at many fine -- and not so fine -- restaurants. This is easily the worst. Best advice, RUN DO NOT WALK away from this horrible and rude dining experience."

Text = "After waiting in line for 40 minutes, we finally picked up our meals and were led to the hostess station where we waited another 10 minutes for a table. When a table was located, it had not been cleaned from the previous diners, so again we waited. We were sat behind a big pillar in the magicians room and caught the last 3 minutes of the act (which was nothing special). The food wasn't fit for my dog, it was horrible. The wait staff was non-existant and when our waitress finally came, it took her another 30 minutes to get back with our drinks. The food was bland, chicken tasted regurgitated, and the cheese was a cheap imitatation of velveta...disgusting!! After the meal, lack of entertainment, and service, I asked for our dessert to be canceled, game tokens refunded, and could not get out of there quick enough. We ran to the nearest store to buy some mints to get the taste out of our mouths. We then went out to eat at a real restraunt with entertainment, Dave and Busters. Don't waste your time or money on this place, it stinks!"

I think the only thing I've ever liked, after eating at Olga's sporadically since like age 5 or younger, would be the grilled cinnamon bun with butter on it. And that's it. I despise this place and it's nothing but a South Jersey landmark that they should revamp totally or perhaps knock down and just leave the sign for nostalgia's sake."

After I placed the order I even called back to make sure that I had ordered the Chef Salad w/Ranch and she told me yes and that it would be delivered between 12:00 and 12:30 and I waited until 12:30 and I finally called again and I was told the delivery person had the order. I never received the order and I sat at my desk hungry until 1:00 pm and I decided to call back and she told me that I never placed an order because she did not have a ticket for me. I work for a large organization and they do a great deal of business here and she told me that they did not have one order for where I worked for but several and she didn't have one for me. I asked her if she would have my order delivered because she was the one who messed it up and I was hungry. She told me no because they did not deliver after 1:00 p.m. She asked me did I want to speak to the manager and I said please, she returned to the phone and told me the manager could not talk to me or help me because there was not a ticket for me, which meant I hadn't placed an order. Why would I have to lie and why would I keep calling if I hadn't placed and order. I would like everyone at UMC to know how these people are because I am sure over 50% of their business comes from here. No one tried to rectify the situation by at least delivering me my salad or letting me come to pick it up and nobody cared whether I was diabetic or not or needed to eat at a certain time. I feel that these people are rude and doesn't deserve my business. Word of mouth is still the best form of advertisment.l"

The food was enjoyable but nothing more than average. The atmosphere was quite neat with the running water and flames. A very dark restaurant. The service stunk! First they brought out my meal and we thought they were going to go back and get my boyfriends. So we sat there waiting and the service finally came around and asked if something was wrong, why wasn't I eating. I asked where my boyfriend's meal was and they said it wouldn't be ready for another five minutes or so. I had to ask them to take my meal back until his was also ready! Who serves one meal but not the other?! It was hard getting our drinks re-filled. It was hard flagging down someone when we needed a condiment or even the check. We won't return."

Text = "The only thing going for this restaurant is the location near Staples Center. Other than that, I'd much rather dine at Taylor's for half the cost, or even Morton's for twice the food. I continually got the impression from the staff at this restaurant that they were much, much better than me and that they really did not need my business. It was my first time dining there and it was my last time dining there. I went there based on the recommendation from the LA Times. The Times has also recieved a letter from me regarding their misguided review. I went with my wife and another couple. We waited for 45 minutes at the front desk even though we had reservations. Consequently, we had to rush our dinner to get to the theatre on time. The waitress ignored us, making us feel we weren't as important as the wealthy businessmen seated next to us. At one point, I got up and got my own water from a nearby water pitcher, walking right by our waitress. She didn't even care. Three of the four steaks ordered at our table had to be sent back. One medium-rare was so well-done. When my steak was returned to me, the plate was dropped on the table and juice splattered on my shirt. No staff member noticed or even cared for that matter. This restaurant is good for taking your out of town tourists friends just so they can enjoy the "LA experience". The Palm is the epitome of LA. Here they can see shallow, want-to-be actors who rudely and cluelessly wait on you, here today-gone tomorrow actors that think they are the messiah, and loud, drunk sport hooligans who feel it is there birthright to act like gorillas. I felt like I was on the set of the movie "L.A. Story", only Steve Martin wasn't there to entertain these disgruntled customers. I am no prude, I just expected more from this place."

Upon arriving the outside of the building was nice, the atomosphere was very nice. I thought ok this is going to be good. When I looked at the buffet I was disappointed. For the price there should be more to choose from. But, I was still optomistic. When I tried the food, it was disgusting. You could actually see the grease settleing on the food. And we were early for dinner. For a building of that size, you would have thought the buffet area could have been spread out more. Instead of all the tables being crammed together in a little room. Also, we sit the the smoking area. The outside door had been propped open. I suppose so the flies could come eat with us. There were staff members continuously coming in and out of the other emergency door. Just over all not a pleasant experience. When we decided to leave. At 7:00. I ask our waitress for the check. At 7:15, still no check. At 7:20, I had to actually get up and go tell someone that I would like our check please. At 7:30, we were fianally given our check. I think I expect more for $60.(2 people)"

We will certainly miss their food, but when we called in tonight to say that one of the dishes we had received in our delivery order was not correct, we were met with rude, snide, insulting service. The man who identified himself as the owner suggested that my husband was a liar; later, he suggested that my husband was crazy.   My husband told me later that he could hear the kitchen staff laughing in the background during his exchange with the owner. I heard the conversation from my husband's end, and while I won't deny that I'm biased, he was calm and polite throughout - from what I heard, the owner was angry and informed my husband that he did not care whether he lost us as customers - we simply wanted the dish that we had ordered.   The woman who identified herself as the manager also suggested that my husband was a liar, and when I got on the phone to describe the dish that we were expecting to get and referred to it as spicy, she mockingly said something to the effect of - "spicy? That dish is not spicy. Who told you that dish is spicy?" We were both very surprised - we ordered takeout from Thai 101 frequently, and again, all we wanted was the dish that we ordered. By the end of the conversation, an apology would have been nice too."

Text = "A big fanfare preceded the opening including the big deal about using Fen Shui in the layout. A couple of days after the opening (September 13, 02) my wife and I visited the restaurant. For apetizer we had Peking dumplings which were ok. Then, my wife ordered Kung Pao chicken and I ordered Szechuan beef. Both of the dishes were dry and tasteless, but the worse part was that, after a couple of bites, I found a 3 inch wire in my dish! We called the manager, who first just stood there for a moment, and then she said: "We will not charge you for it", and left in a rush. I did not eat the rest of my dish, and my wife reluctantly finished hers. Not only was a disgusting and dangerous experience, but the manager's reaction was wrong and nonchalant to say the least. Respectful, concerned, and capable managers would not only give you a new dish, but would not charge you for the whole meal. Incidentally, the table was so small that even the small portions we were given did not quite fit in the table! We have visited many chinese restaurants all over the States and Europe, and never had such an unpleasant experience: lousy table, lousy food and lousy management. l & Diana Bolanos"

Text = "This restaurant placed an advertisement in the homeowner's coupons distributed by Merchant & Publisher of Long Island. The coupon was distributed with Free Dinner/Lunch Entree-no holidays. I chose this place due to the coupon and had a very horrible experience. 1. I arrived at 2:45pm and was given a dinner menu, when the waiter came I asked for the lunch menu. He left to get place setting for the table and was gone for approx 5 min, when he came back, I asked for the lunch menu and was told that lunch stopped serving at 3:00pm. I explained to him that it was 2:50pm and not 3:00pm and that I wanted to be served from the lunch menu. He refused. 2. My other party group 3(excluding myself) decided to go ahead an order from the dinner menu. I presented the coupon to the waiter on the free dinner entree when you buy one of equal value. He said he will take at the end of the meal. He then came back to the table and told us that the manager says that today was a holiday. the day was Tues 12/31/02. We explained that the holiday is tomorrow New Years Day 1/1/03, however, he refused to take the coupon. the party did continue to eat since they had already started. The bottom line is that THIS RESTUARANT USED THE COUPON TO LURE PATRONS TO THE RESTAURANT AND CHANGE RULES IN MID STREAM. ALL OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS BEHAVIOR. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT THE US AND INTL, ESPECIALLY SINCE I TRAVEL HEAVILY FOR MY JOB, AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED IN MY LIFE. PLEASE ADVERTISE THIS ON THE SITE SO OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT PLACED IN THIS DILEMMA. IF I WAS ALONE AND NOT HAVE COMPANY WITH ME, I WOULD HAVE WALKED OUT AND LEFT HIS FOOD SITTING ON THE TABLE."

Text = "The Black Bear Diner is like no other diner, you can tell from the moment you enter the restaurant and see the cool bear theme. The menus are printed on a 1927 edition of a newspaper apparently sponsored by the Carmel Pine Cone, a local newspaper which is owned by a couple of close personal friends of mine, Paul Miller and Kirstie Wilde. The Black Bear philosophy has six credos, number 4 states: "If you don't say. "WOW", when your food arrives, you either ordered toast, or my chef had a flashback to the days when they were working somewhere else" (I paraphrased that). To tell you the truth, I had no intention of saying "Wow", when my food arrived, but guess what, I did!! I had no choice, The Black Bear Diner offers such large portions. They don't skimp on the portions or the flavor, there was no doggie bag needed, at least, in my case I cleaned my plate. The Black Bear Diner serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, now that I know about the Black Dear Diner, I shall return."

Another thing was that when we were getting our foods from the buffet area, there were employees carrying around hot food and it brushed up against me. On a positive note the food was excellent and the price was very reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."

Text = "I went to Davitino's with my mother and 2 year old son. During the meal the owner/manager walks by and gasps and yells oh my god because my son had dropped some noodles on the floor by his chair. She then sends someone over to VACUUM THEM UP while we are eating our meal!! She continued to rudely stare at my son throughout the rest of our meal, I just couldn't believe it. Davitino's used to be one of my favorite places, but after that incident, I, nor any of my family, will ever eat there again. This was not the first time we have been treated rudely by her, I don't know why I ever went back!!!! P.S. I always clean up the food my son drops on the floor before we leave a restaurant!"

Text = "We found this restaurant by accident. It is located just off Route 46 and Passaic Avenue on Little Falls Road. When we called for reservations, we were told to bring our own wine as Aria was BYOB. The sounds of live piano, the ambiance of a beautiful Tuscan villa - it was elegant. We were immediately served wonderful warm bread and complementary bruschetta. The menu had many appetizers, and about 20 entrees, and the waiter gave us quite a list of specials. For Appetizers, we enjoyed Warm Eggplant and Mozzarella Timbale in a Tomato Fondue, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella with Tomato and Roasted Pepper, Fresh Mozzarella between Crispy Pan-Fried Bread, and Mixed Seafood Salad. All were excellent, and the Seafood Salad was quite large. I had an arugula salad with Gorgonzola cheese, pears, and walnuts with balsamic vinagrette that was delicious. All the entrees were delicious from the simple Penne Arrabbiata, to the Chicken Marsala - Chicken scaloppini in a wild mushroom and Marsala wine sauce, to Chicken Paillard - paper thin chicken breast grilled and drizzled with fresh herb olive oil, to my favorite - Baked Salmon - blackened and bathed in almond and horseradish sauce served on a bed of fennel. Wonderful coffee, cappucino, and espresso, and dessert including cheesecake with strawberries and sauce; tartufo, and an exceptional tri-colored mousse finished our delightful dining experience."

It was too difficult to get our waiter's attention, and we just gave up. We have been here many times over 25 years. The service continues to decline.

Text = "Well I called and made a reservation for 9:00 on a Wednesday night in June..I was told by the woman who answered that it wasn't necessary, but just to be safe I made one anyway. We arrived at 10 to 9 and were told we had to wait a few minutes so we sat at the bar and ordered a round of drinks. About 25 minutes and another round of drinks later we were seated.( Prepare yourself...the drinks were very expensive our bill was 60.00 just for the bar portion!)As we were seated the dining room wasn't as busy as we expected having waited for as long as we did.We were famished and since we didn't need drinks (still had the second round) we asked our server to bring us bread while we made our dinner selections . He said he would be right back.......15 minutes later...he returned to take our order but forgot to bring the bread! Ok everyone makes mistakes...even when they're not busy. He could have easily been a part of the calamity transpiring in the kitchen....it was very unprofessional..very Jerry Springer-ish. We should have walked out but at 10:45 we were sort of stuck...most restaurants close at 10...so we reluctantly stayed. On a more positive note the food was decent....better than we expected. The price ,however, was a shock. My husband ordered a veal dish and asked if the excess sauce could substitute the standard bland marinara atop the included side of linguini....our waiter said it would not be a problem "It is a common request that we are happy to substitute" were his words.So the rest of us requested the same sauce to be on our linguiniI. The dinner was good and we forgot the earlier part of the evening . Then the bill came.. after scrutinizing it we were shocked to see that this common request was expensive ,to say the least! $8.00 for each side of free linguini... the sauce that most chefs have excess of left in the pan and discard .Unbelieveable and inconceivable...$32.00 extra for something we were lead to believe to be included. Our waiter misguided us. Very dissapointing.When we tried to dispute this to our waiter..he sent us to the cashier...who was an owner. When we disputed this ,,she acted as if she didn't understand the charge, told our server to request an explanation from the kitchen,,,,after we waited 25 minutes, we were told that the chef was too busy to explain his charges. So we were left standing there with a blank look from the cashier and the snooty barmaid....with no other explanation other than that we should pay our bill and go on our way!.We were even approached by a burly man from the kitchen who threatened us .I was furious and felt cheated. Although the food was decent...the attitude and overall customer service level was lousy and very unprofessional."

Text = "First, the atmosphere was OK. Nothing overly nice, just OK. The concept of bringing meats wrapped in siran wrap to the table and having the server endlessly drone on about them is awful. Who wants to see a steak wrapped in plastic? And, what good does that do me, the patron? It's a dumb gimmick and should be stopped. On to the food: for starters we had the scallops wrapped in bacon and the grilled asparagus. Both tasted fine, but were way over-priced. 3 scallops for 12 bucks is a bit much -- even if your name is Mortons. Since they tasted OK, I had no real problem with the price. Where I really had a problem was with the big event -- my porterhouse was pretty much awful. I've had much better at restaurants at half the price and in my own kitchen. It was cooked by someone who clearly knew nothing about cooking steak. And, the quality of the cut left much to be desired. My wife had the filet Oskar, which seemed OK, other than the fact that there were two, count them two, medium sized pieces of crabmeat on the entire plate. The whole idea of Oskar is crabmeat and asparagus over a meat. Again, premium price for crappy food. Mashed potaties were any basic version. Mushrooms were over-powered with garlic. Wine was way over-priced, but was well-presented. Overall, this is not even in the top ten steak places in a city that has generally lousy restaurants. Hey Mr. Morton, you can't live off your name forever -- people who like good food will figure you out!"

Text = "My first contact with Openas Restaurant was September 2004. My wife (at that time she was my fiance) and I visited Openas to contract them as caterers for our wedding. We consulted with them, decided on a package, and placed a refundable deposit. The next day we telephoned the restaurant to clarify some items in our package. We could not come to agreement on several items and realized that this clarification should have been done during our face-to-face meeting the previous day. We acknowledged this and decided to switch to another caterer. I telephoned Openas to cancel our package and return the deposit. Their policy is a return of 75% of the deposit for any cancellation. I was quite surprised to hear them tell me that a return of the deposit was not forthcoming. We were bound to use them and they refused to return any portion of the 50,000 peso deposit. Subsequent telephone calls to Openas that week were ignored. We were told only three days after placing the deposit that they no longer had the money. They refused to speak with me and terminated the phone conversation. Subsequent phone calls have resulted in abrupt terminations and they refuse to discuss the matter. This matter is now being pursued legally."

Maybe I am lucky and the previous reviewer is continually unlucky. Or maybe the reviewer is just too good for this simple diner. The Silver Spoon has always been clean, and the staff has always been happy and very on-the-ball with service. Someone shaving in the bathroom is odd, but can the restaurant really control that? Did the reviewer inform the management and if so, did the management correct the problem? The decor is VERY 1970's, maybe even older, but that is apart of the diner's charm. Where has Rip Taylor and Shelley Winters been all these years? Here at the Silver Spoon. I've seen them here many times, and they are just nonchalant diners eating diner food. There is no pretention here. Just a simple diner. During weekend brunchs, many of the local homosexuals gather here like flocks of flamingoes while nursing hangovers from the previous night. I think this just adds to the character of the restaurant. Who needs Dulce or Spago anyway? As a simple, high maintenance diner I prefer the Silver Spoon."

We took notice of what we thought was a pizzeria . WOW were we mistaken. When we walked into the dining roon we noticed granite floors and marble walls. The side walls were all done in murals done by a local artist depicting a Sicilian setting. There was also a Authentic espresso and cappuccino bar along with allll! the Torani syrups for the coffees! (The owner went to great lenghts to decorate this place). We ordered from the Chef's Specials and our waiter was very good and well informed. We asked to speak to the chef and he came out immedietly. Althogh very busy he came out of the kitchen looking more like an actor or model than a chef . He had an arroagant look but was very cherming and answered all our questions. We orderd thecollasal shrimp ala Vito (the chef's name and the veal wich was stuffed with lobster and crabmeat both were excellent!!!!! What can i say so was dessert wich is made homemade!! So next time your in Browns Mills and driving to the shore or at the N.J cranberry festival make sure to stop by Riccardo's ....you'll be surprised at the incredible food and possibly one of the best chef's and best kept secret in NJ!!!!!!!

From the outside, Riccardo's gives the impression of being another pizzeria but inside, it is an adventure in fine dining. In my husband's work, he speaks to people from all over the country but when he finds someone from NJ, he always recommends Riccardo's. Vito always manages to visit with his customers, asking where they are from, have they been there before, and give the personal touch that other establishments don't offer. Riccardo's is definately a place not to be passed by!"

Text = "We go here pretty often since it is pretty close by, plus we love our sushi chef "Eddie" - we secretly call him Eddie the Lover. lol Their sushi tastes really good and the taste and service is very consistent. I usually order the seaweed salad, unagi roll, baked green mussel and hot green tea, plus an iced tea. By the time I am finished with my meal my green tea is cool enough for me to sip. My fiance, Marc, is not a big sushi eater and only gets two spider rolls and a coke - every time. His palate is not very adventurous. The prices are very good and the staff very friendly, as I have found most sushi bars to be. The sushi bar is quite large btw. The average meal for us is about $40. but I am a pig. I once split a bottle of cold ginger-flavored sake ($15.00) with Eddie, and it took me by surprise how strong it was. I exclaimed, I can't feel my face!! and told him he was trying to get me drunk. lol If you ever go and sit at the bar, ask for Eddie and he will take really good care of you and keep you laughing."

Text = "My experience at Justin's was wonderful-If you aren't really familiar with this restaurant it is owned by the multi-million dollar man P.Diddy and boy his taste is something else. The food is Soul-Food everything from Puffy's Fried Chicken, sweet potato's etc;. The overall professionalism of the staff is remarkable, they even have valet parking. The area of Buckhead Atlanta is very suburb like with the most finest shops & stores around even the people are kind and nice. The wait was not long at all and it is very spacious & upscale. If you're in the Atlanta area or New York check Justin's out. It will be worth your wild."

The 2nd and 3rd times have been because it was a friend's birthday (who requested to try it) and the 3rd time was because they advertised internet connections (which wasn't true). The food was terrible, cold when should be warm, soup was burned tasting, told side salad was $2.50 and charged $3.00. Promised cannolis because of the problems - then another person said they wouldn't give them to us. Overall, terrible. I will tell everyone I know not to go to Cinelli's."

Text = "My husband had heard about this place & wanted to see what it was like. It is near the Stockyards & that should have told us something! It was a dump on the outside! The inside was a little better. Poor parking, & when we got inside, we found they were not happy we didn't have a reservation, so, they stuck us in the back where it looked like they hadn't updated it-ever! (We were unaware we needed a reservation HERE!) The waitress wasn't very friendly & seemed a little impatient with us. The bus boys hovered & made us feel uncomfortable during our dinner. Like they wanted us to hurry & leave. The food was just barely ok. The steak tasted like it had only been processed for a very short amount of time. Not 'aged' properly. Now, Kansas City is known for its beef & BBQ. Please don't let THIS restaurant be the yardstick upon which all restaurants are measured! Take my advice, if you want good beef & bbq-stay away from this place!"

Text = "Many friends had described the Hudson International Buffet to me as one of the best restaurants there is. I went there to inspect for myself and brought along two friends, hoping for a delicious meal and expecting the best. I ended up leaving halfway through and relocating to a better restaurant. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a crabby hostess who seemed to angry to care whether or not I said "hello" or "how are you". I was snubbed and directed to a booth where I was greeted again with coldness. "Maybe it's just me", I had pondered but soon came to realize that they were that way to every customer whether to my rear or to my sides. And then, the buffet. I got a plate full only to find that two black hairs were already cooked and inside both the Lo Mein and the General Tso's Chicken. When I had spoken to one of the Waitresses, she had merely ignored my complaint and acted as if she never heard me. though the atmosphere was okay, I was not treated to fine dining or even average dining. The food was all either too salty, or not flavored enough and the seafood tasted at least a few days old. I also have recently found out that one time when they were closed (before that disastrous day I had tried to go once) for one or two days, it was due to them failing a health inspection. Indeed, their food is not fresh. or clean. I recommend for no one to go there and go to other great places I've gone to since like the China Buffet by T.J. Maxx or The Imperial Buffet. I personally enjoy the China Buffet very much."

Text = "Diners who come to this location expecting to see the Cici's represented in television ads will be sorely disappointed. Slightly seedy, and overcrowded with video arcade games and gumball machines that attract families with young children allowed to run amuck, this franchise is housed in a storefront in the mostly deserted end of a strip mall just off U.S. 19. The concept is great - all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta, salad, and dessert for the incredibly low price of $3.99. But after a change in management in early 2005, quality and service began to slide, and our most recent visit convinced us not to return again. Although all the salad bar extras - cherry tomatoes, black olives, cucumber slices, and the like - were fresh, the greens themselves were brown and wilted. One pasta was barely cooked, the other boiled to mush. The marinara sauce was bland but at least it was hot; the Alfredo sauce was ice cold. Pizzas were either underbaked or burnt. There wasn't much variety in the selections offered - a preponderance of peopperoni prevailed - and although we were told we could have a pie prepared to order, our selection still hadn't been made 30 minutes after our arrival. Unfortunately, when it finally made it to the table, it wasn't what we had ordered. The place looked and felt less than clean, possibly because dirty tables remained unbussed long after their occupants had departed. Noise level is a problem here when the place is crowded, and a blurry, widescreen TV set on a cable news channel that nobody seemed to be watching simply added to the din. The many negatives make the price tag less of the bargain it was when this place was operated in a more professional, caring manner. Get your Cici's fix at another location, because this one has lost its appeal."

Text = "A new restaurant specializing in North Indian Cusine. Chefs speciality is the traditional tikkas; boneless chicken or lamb marinated and skewer cooked in a tandoor. The restaurant owner Inder Singh is friendly and makes the meanest chicken and lamb tikkas in the Bay Area. The tikkas are succulent, melting in the mouth and then the flavor of the spices explodes. The traditional pita bread (a.k.a. naan's) are excellent too and they have it in several flavors. Try any of the tikkas. My personal favotites are Achari Chicken Tikka and the Malai Chicken Tikka. The service is effecient and friendly. The price is good, $7 to $10 a la carte."

It's really frustrating, because it used to be pretty good, but now everything arrived quite overcooked and bland. Someone has forgotten how to season in the kitchen, or simply doesn't think Vermonters have any sense of taste. Their foccacia used to be the best bread around, but the last couple of times I went it has obviously been toasted, and over-toasted. The wine, which came from a bottle more or less untampered with by the kitchen, was the best part of my meal, but I don't plan on giving them another chance; I've wasted enough money there."
