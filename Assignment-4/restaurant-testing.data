Text = "The food we ordered was delicious, and the amount of food was more than adequate for the price we paid. The wait staff were courteous and attentive to our needs. The only complaints I have are that the hostess was a little snippy and they were out of onion blossom appetizers. Otherwise, everything else was quite above average. Our meal started with potato skins smothered in melted cheese and bacon. Next came the salads and piping hot bread. The main courses arrived next. I had the half-pound cut of prime rib with a baked potato and broccoli. As prime rib is one of my favorite dine-out meals, I am very particular on how it is prepared. The chef did an excellent job...it was perfect. I would highly recommend this restaurant."

Text = "It was my birthday and I wanted the family to eat here because I thought they would like it. I had previously had fair experiences with this place before but now I will never go back. The overpriced food should at least ensure above average service. But it didn't. The waitress couldn't remember who ordered what (there were only six of us), she brought out wrong items which she couldn't make time to replace so I had to actually get the owner to replace it for me, then most of the table had to reorder after already sitting there for 20 minutes because their "special of the day" no longer existed, she blamed this on the cooks which it was an obvious mistake of her own, next she brought our orders out at separate times, lastly my plate was the most expensive and yet it was a very simple item to make (a stir fry vegetables with pasta plate) which I had before and just by looking at it I could tell that it was terribly over cooked. At this point I had lost my appetite with the attempt! My food tasted bland and rancid all at once. I ended up not eating much of anything and by the time I had received my food everyone else was nearly done eating and it was pointless to get them to remake my food. On top of all of this the waitress had the gall to complain about the modest tip that was left for her as a hint of "you are not doing you job" which I overheard her say while passing the kitchen."

Text = "Sweatman's is the mecca of South Carolina barbeque. Saying it is the best barbeque s an understatement. If you make the trip and can find this place you will eat the best pulled barbeque and by far the best hash and rice you will ever eat in your entire life and maybe your next life. The atmosphere only adds to the flavor of the food. It is an old house in the middle of the country that is only open on the weekend. They cook the pigs right out back starting the night before which anyone who knows is how long you need to cook good barbeque, all night and very, very slowly. If you like barbeque or if you hate it, you will never have any better period. This is the place in the state that all the good barbeque cooks learned the trade and secrets of good ole' lowcountry barbeque and hash. If you are driving to Charleston or anywhere near there, take the holly hill exit off of I-26 and head to eutawville and ask someone how to get there, I promise you will not be disapointed. Only open on Friday & Saturday."

Their Clam Clam Clam Chowder is thicker and creamier than most and way more flavorful and has more clam pieces. My entree, garlic parmesan chicken pasta, was excellent. The sauce was light and not overpowering. The pasta was cooked correctly. The host stopped by twice while we were there to see if everything was up to our expectations. The waitress asked if we needed refills before they were gone. The menu is versatile and they offer a large selection of beer on tap, most notably the best microbrews from the area. Overall, the experience was way beyond compare."

Text = "You can decorate a high school gymnasium for the junior prom with all the balloons and crepe paper you can find, but underneath it all it still looks pretty much like a gym. The same holds true with Mecca, which was carved out of a vast empty space on the ground level of a condominium complex. Ornate floral arrangements crowd the entrance, heavy velvet draperies separate the dining room from the bar, and tables are covered with starched white cloths and candles, but the concrete floors and walls and exposed pipes and air conditioning ducts overhead make this place feel more like a warehouse than the old-time supper club it aspires to be. In a city where outstanding restaurants proliferate, I don't quite understand either the appeal or success of Mecca. Its clientele consists mostly of chic 20 and 30-somethings with lots of disposable income, who appear to be there more to be seen than to enjoy a decent meal. Dressed to the nines, they pose at the circular bar three deep, shouting at each other in a vain attempt to be heard above the criminally loud sound system. Mecca may yearn to be a supper club, but it moves to the beat of a disco. Apparently the owners have lost sight of the fact that in all those 1940s "Thin Man" films, William Powell and Myrna Loy never tossed off clever quips while a DJ spun records in the background. I mention disposable income because dining here requires it. This is not a place for young marrieds with a babysitter watching the kids, or an older couple on a fixed income. The prices here are steep; with cocktails and wine added to the cost of an entree, one could easily pay in excess of $100 for dinner here - and walk out hungry. Mecca is one of those restaurants where you see more plate than food when your meal is placed before you. As a starter, warm crab salad ($13.75) sounded like a good idea, but it was swimming in a hollandaise sauce so heavily flavored with vanilla that it tasted more like a dessert course. Pan-roasted scallops with black trumpet mushrooms and fava bean puree were more successful, but at $11.50 there should have been more than two tiny scallops in the serving. A small portion of roast chicken ($14.75) had skin the color of ebony; the meat was dry and the sauce tasted burnt. The couscous with raisins on which it rested had soaked up much of the sauce and therefore had no distinctive flavor of its own. Seared ahi tuna ($21.50) was nearly raw; we requested it be cooked a little more, and when it returned it was overdone and tasteless. Service, at our table at least, was indifferent. Our waiter was too busy flirting with the party of four young men at the next table to pay us much attention. We waited forever for our appetizers, and had just started them when our main courses were thrust upon us. The waiter placed all blame on the kitchen, but clearly the fault was his. Our plates were finally removed long after we finished our meal, and there was another long wait before we could ask for and then finally get our check. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the meal, the waiter stared back in silence. Our comments to the maitre d' elicited the response that hopefully next time things would be better. What made him think we'd consider a next time when nobody cared that this time was a disaster? Valet parking adds to the notion that you're eating in an upscale restaurant, but in this neighborhood, where finding a spot within reasonable walking distance could take an hour or so, it's practically mandatory. Ironically, just around the corner is Chow, which I have reviewed previously and which surpasses Mecca in every way imaginable, at a mere fraction of the cost. Spare yourself some aggravation and eat there instead."

So far so good I thought, however we sat 15 minutes and not even a glass of water was brought to our table. We observed several other tables be seated and were quickly attended to by the staff. My wife went to the host to ask if our table was assigned? He said he would take care of it. Well 5 more minutes passed and two other tables were seated and were immediatly served that we said we had enough. We got up to leave as we passed the "host" we informed him that we were leaving. His reply was "I told them" and followed by offering us a drink. We said "No thank you". We felt disgusted and appalled by the way the situation was handled. We went to a local eatery and told our tale to several friends who were eating there. We learned from them that they and several other couples they knew had also walked out of the place. In all our years of dining, WE HAVE NEVER WALKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT."

The staff is very friendly and they even allow you to write your name on the wall so I wrote we8there.com see if you can find our name.

Text = "We (my fiance and I) were very excited upon arrival due to the many good reviews we had heard before coming. We were promptly seated in the basement, as the restaurant was very busy. We later learned that this was the Chinese New Year - apparently it fell on a Wednesday night for 2004. We waited approximately 10 minutes before a waiter arrived at the table. When the waiter arrived we ordered 2 mixed drinks and 2 waters. About 30 minutes later the waiter came back to take our order for the food, but during our wait and my stares at the waiter, we saw the wait staff place a soup pot at the wrong table. The people at this table began eating from the large soup pot, and then the mistake was discovered; so what happens next; the waiter takes the pot of soup to the correct table (a bunch of college kids); while I would have refused to eat the soup, these starved college kids who had also registered numerous complaints began to eat the soup. 20 minutes after we initially ordered, 2 of our dishes arrived. Pot stickers and General Tao's Chicken. We still had not received our drinks or our water. By this time I was headed up to speak to the manager, and ask him about our drinks. He assured me that they would be right to the table now that he was aware of the situation. I headed back downstairs to my table. 15 minutes later our third and final dish arrived. Szechwan Chicken, which was breaded and deep-fried so much it, resembled something similar to a pork rind. The dish was also drowned in dry chilies. My fiance could not eat the food at all, and I (fearing impending dental work) sent the crispy critters back. We still had not received our drinks or our water. This time I complained to a different waiter about the drink situation and within 10 minutes the Manager brought down our drinks, which were mediocre at best. The manager eventually took the Szechwan Chicken and drinks off of our bill, but the damage was already done. To summarize: The service is terrible: The food is worse than many Chinese buffets. The atmosphere might be all right if they do not send you to the basement. I would never go or recommend this restaurant to anyone."

Text = "We posted a review of the Shady Maple Smorgasbord back in November of 2003 and gave our honest opinion as to the quality of their establishment.We stand by our opinion that not only was the food bland,but that most of it was not even freshly prepared and was of a mass-produced,pre-packaged nature.We have been visiting Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Dutch region annually for the last 11 years,and despite what the previous reviewer has to say,we do appreciate the cooking styles unique to the region.We expect freshly-prepared dishes lightly seasoned so that one tastes the true flavors of the ingredients,not just the spices.We do not,however,expect a true Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant to serve food that would be more suitable for the Hometown Buffet.Both my maternal and paternal grandmothers were excellent cooks in their own ways,but if one of them had prepared food of the type served at the Shady Maple Smorgasbord I would have wondered which industrial kitchen she was employed at!We are not saying that the food here was disgusting,just not what we expected after all that we had heard over the years.We are just stating our opinion that,of the dozens of restaurants that we have dined at in the region over the past 11 years,the Shady Maple Smorgasbord was the most disappointing. This is a forum where we are all free to give voice to our opinions on any given restaurant.We have no problem if someone disagrees with our opinion and wants to post their own conflicting review.Please,however,do not call into question our knowledge of various styles of cuisine.We take great effort to be fair in our opinions.Sometimes we are probably too lenient.Thank you."

We were started with Sourdough bread and whipped butter – sad to say this was the highlight of our experience. Everything went downhill from here. For appetizers we were intrigued by the Buffalo Shrimp ($7.99). What a waste of seafood! For entrees, I had the Hawaiian Chicken and Shrimp Salad with Coconut Mango Dressing ($10.99). The dressing- the coconut overpowered the mango; the pineapple was clearly out of a can and the chicken strips from the Perdue package or the deli section of the grocery. The greens were even worse! Not one ingredient in this salad was fresh! Hubby had a Bacon Cheddar burger ($6.99) —it was decent, charbroiled (can't go wrong with that) and a nice size. Big disappointment in general, though no surprise. Other items that sounded appetizing: the Kalamata Pesto Bruschetta ($6.99). I guess we'll never find out if this is good or not."

This is because with almost every dish you will be getting a side order of either french fries or mashed potaoes. I can go into how bad their other dishes are including their mashed potatoes but lets stick to something simple like french fries. French fries need to be well cooked on the inside and crispy on the outside. At beadles neither is done. I cook better fries and I'm only a commercial truck driver. If you have a cook that cannot cook french fries then it's time to get an entirely different cook and I don't mean his brother either."

There are a bountiful number of choices here, a few of them actually edible, but for the most part the cuisine borders on the disastrous. You can't go wrong if you stick to the salad bar, where everything is fresh. It's the hot buffet selections that are the kitchen's downfall. Salt appears to be the only seasoning in use here, and there's far too much of it in everything. The pink meat warned us that the roast chicken was dangerously undercooked, whereas the bourbon chicken was burnt and tough. Meatloaf contained more bread filler than it did meat. The pot roast was fatty, overdone, too dry, and tasteless. French fries were perfect, but mashed potatoes needed to be doctored quite a bit. Pizza was underbaked, leaving the dough white and chewy. Television ads promise steaks 1" thick, but you didn't need a ruler to see this claim is way off the mark. Steaks are precooked, then thrown on the grill to heat up, making rare impossible and medium rare unlikely. The fried onions offered with them were done well, but the mushrooms tasted boiled rather than sauteed. Soups were weak and flavorless. Desserts are plentiful and, for the most part, very good - just avoid the soft serve "ice cream," which had a peculiar texture and taste. A nearby server was attentive to all her tables, but we had to request clean plates and drink refills several times before ours responded. The noise level is very high at peak dining times, and negotiating your way between tables and through the various food lines can be treacherous in a crowd. We had been here once before for Sunday brunch and had returned based on how pleased we had been with our meal, but obviously they do eggs far better than anything more ambitious. This is clearly a place popular with families and senior citizens on fixed incomes, but those who are seeking a decent meal and can afford higher prices definitely are advised to eat elsewhere."

We ordered breakfast - 3 grand slams with coffee and the bill after tax (before tip - a mismomer - WE DIDNT LEAVE ONE THE SERVICE WAS SO PATHETIC) was $42. Yes that's a 4 followed by a 2 in Canadian dollars about $30 US. We'll NEVER go to this or any Denny's in the Niagara area EVER AGAIN!!! We also checked out another one near the Hilton Hotel - which we were told was owned by the Hilton - and it was exactly the same expensive menu. For those prices, we'll eat AT the Hilton. There was another Denny's on Lundy's Lane but after seeing the other two, we wouldn't waste our time checking it out. Oh, almost forgot - the food was HORRID! Eggs were not as ordered and we were told the cook couldn't do it the way we asked?? Excuse me?? What kind of a cook can't poach an egg for crying out loud? We were politely TOLD to take it or leave it unless we wanted to reorder and pay for it as well. That was the last straw and we ate and ran, probably what they wanted us to do anyway."

The food was second rate. The seabass I ordered had been steamed beyond recognition. When my wife ordered a glass of wine, the glass itself was filthy.

After hearing many compliments about Sunset, we were excited about eating there, but I wouldn't eat there again even if the meal was free.

They were provided a special appetizer, attentive but discrete service. Their courses were spaced wonderfully; allowing them to enjoy their meal and your atmosphere. Their water was filled as necessary, and their plates were cleared after they had finished the course and had time to clear their palate for the next serving. That particular couple were seated when we arrived. When we left, they were just being served their main dish. They were clearly being offered service that reflected their desire to enjoy the evening at your establishment. How do we get such service? We were rushed from the moment we arrived. We were hurried to place our orders quickly. Our plates were taken before we finished our course. We treated with utmost disrespect, as if we were a burden upon you. Our courses were brought to us before our previous course was complete, and they were not even warm. To add insult to this injury, the Maitre D' constantly interrupted us to take chairs from our table to suit her needs. (We noticed that she didn't bother the "special" guests to whom we refer above.) We went out to have a pleasant, leisurely evening. They know how to offer that (you did for the other couple). Instead, we had a horrible experience. They got our money. And our lasting memory of an awful evening."

Text = "Probably one of my most unusual and unpleasant lunch experiences. We ordered iced tea for drinks and they were served in very small highball type glasses with more ice than tea. So during the course of the meal we had to ask for more tea. I should have known something was up when we got new glasses each time. When the bill came our iced tea chargel alone was $7.50. We were charged $1.50 for each glass of tea. When I asked the waitress about the unreasonable drink bill, she informed us that there are no refills on drinks. I asked why she had not informed us of that and here curt response was "It's in the menu"! I asked to see the menu and yes it did say that, but in very small print well below the drink section of the menu. I put the bill on my charge and did not leave a tip. When we were just outside the front door, this waitress charged out and wanted to know where her tip was. I told her that the bartender had it in the form of an outrageous drink bill. She then went back inside and slammed the door. I was not going to say anything about the bill, but after that experience I sought out the owner. He explained the drink policy, but just blew me off about the conduct of the waitress. Needless to say on subsequent visits to beautiful Door County, we have avoided this unfriendly place."

After arriving at 7pm, we were STILL waiting to be seated at 9:30pm and didn't see a crumb of food until almost 10:30pm. Overpriced, mediocre-tasting food and the longest wait ever for the privilege of it all. The "theme" wasn't enough to get me to overlook everything else."

The server paid very close attention to what your needs were and fullfilled them. He answered every question that we had. I have never tasted a better sirloin in my live!!! The food was worth every $$$. I will refer anyone and everyone to 22 Bowens . It's a must have experience!!!!!!!!"

Every roll was drenched in mayonnaise,and my order of Amaebi was shrimp previously frozen...I also had the annoying feeling of waitstaff hovering over me to leave after 20 minutes."

The only problem that I notice is you need a server to get your drinks, a lot of the time it is hard to get the servers attention for a refill because the servers are off in a corner talking to each other. Management needs to do something about this problem."

I actually grew up around the Manning Manse and use to play in wood around there, knew it all my life and never once ate there until the other night at age 53, really don't wait, if you even close to the area, and like a really great family type atmosphere and if you like fried seafood and want to feed about 10 people with one plate, order the fishermans platter for 2, we ordered it for 2 big eaters and still took home four doggy bags, it's s real fun place, if you like the quiet secluded, romance your woman type place, stay away.

Text = "The 80 items this restaurant claims to have on its all-you-can-eat buffet is a gross exaggeration, but to say that the twenty or so dishes on display when we were there were inedible is not. Initially, we thought we were the only patrons at the height of the lunch hour due to its location - nearly at the end of a strip mall (set well back and out of view from the main drag), where the primary draw is a discount dollar store. We quickly discovered that we were probably the only ones there because everyone else who had tried it knew not to return and had warned everyone they could to stay away. Nothing looked fresh, and everything tasted like reheated leftovers from the previous day. How else to explain the stir fry dishes with vegetables the consistency of mush? The soups were thin and tasteless. Pot stickers were dry and rubbery. A pork roast that looked fatty and undercooked inexplicably lay in a pan of greasy water instead of on a carving board. Most of the selections were lukewarm at best. We avoided the seafood and sushi, suspecting the worst. Dessert included stale cream puffs and ice cream coated with freezer burn, further suggesting that few people had eaten there in recent times. Our negative comments to the owner as we paid the check were met by a blank stare. To add insult to injury, all of us suffered severe intestinal distress within an hour after leaving, despite the fact none of us finished eating any one of the items we had selected. Avoid this one like the plague!"

Text = "Worst restaurant I've been to in my 30+ years..The Puritan in manchester, NH is by far the worst I've visited. I visited their online site and found their prices to be a little higher than the other restaurants in the area like the 99 and such. Unfortunately you don't get what you pay for. Puritan does not allow reservations on Fridays and will only allow reservations for 5 or more during the other weeks days, so much for a romantic evening with a loved one. But I thought, hey the place is always packed and must be worth the wait. Unfortunatley the wait was quite long as the waiting room was always full on Fridays. I decided to try take-out instead. I ordered a clam roll and a "bison" burger. On the menu is says the Clam roll(9.95) comes with a kosher and fries. We received the clam roll, maybe 6 clams on the bread, the kosher dried out and a small bag of potato chips, interesting. The "bison" burger is not the only burger on the menu as they list a texas burger with the same toppings added. The "bison" burger is 5.95, a dollar more than the texan burger with the same toppings. One would assume that the bison burger is bigger than the texan because of the additional cost, so I ordered the "bison" burger assuming I'd get a big burger. Additionally the burgers come with lettuce,tomato,onion and mayo, plus the usual kosher and fries. I also ordered the extra toppings of bacon and cheese, an extra $1.20. Total burger cost was 7.15 before tax. What I received was not what I had ordered. I got a burger bun, a small black patty the size of a mcdonalds hamburger with a see through slice of cheese, fries smaller than a mcdonalds small fry and a dried out kosher. You'll take note I did not mention I received any toppings besides the cheese. Besides that, both meals were very cold 20 minutes after ordering as it was sitting in a stack of other take-out meals against a wall near the icecream bin. I tried to eat the burger, but had to rip it in half with both hands to get to the softer dried out parts. I gave up and through it out."

Text = "This restaurant is new and in our neighborhood, and we had high hopes that this could become our regular weekend breakfast place; unfortunately, it was terrible. The potatoes were barely cooked, and most of the food was cool when it arrived from the kitchen (in the back of the restaurant). The "sausage" was simply awful; it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, and was rubbery. The cinnamon roll wasn't too bad, but it was incredibly tiny, a little too doughy, and was $2. The only high note was that the coffee wasn't too bad."

It is placed behind massive glass and accessed by traditional wrought iron spiral staircases. The menu consits of creatively prepared fresh seafood, although there are land items available as well. Tuna lovers should not miss the Crispy Wasabi Tuna wrapped in Phyllo. A succulent tuna tenderloin is rolled in a ginger-pineapple-wasabi paste, then wrapped in phyllo and deep fried for 2-3 minutes. Wow!!!!! This restaurant is part of a group including the famous Magnolias and Blossom."

The pasta special was ourageously priced (more than 2 times most of the other pasta dishes) which was a suprise we only learned about only after getting the bill. On the positive side, the wall of candles was nice as was the fresh bread. In the end, I doubt we will return here again."

The pasta and shrimp were my favorites along with the YaYa a.k.a seafood gumbo ! Watch out for the jerk wings ! Did I mention the leftovers? The entrees are well proportioned.... and are tasty treat when hunger strikes...again! This is a new restaurant we found near the Inner Harbor in Baltimore and it has been described as 'intimate, upscale and delicious!' Indeed so! The service was good ~ and the Manager greeted us at our table to ensure everything was prompt and in order. When you visit Sydnee DeMar you won't leave hungry and you'll have change too! Review submitted by: Angela Singletary 2. Sydnee Demar is one of the best places I have been to in a while. The food was excellent & affordable. The interior design is what impress me the most along with the service that was provided, it was fast & courteous. I strongly recommend this restaurant to many people. If you're looking for good food, a pleasant atmosphere, along with a professional and courteous staff then you need to come to Sydnee Demar ASAP. Much Success & Prayers for this beautiful establishment..."

Text = "This was the very worst dining experience in all of Indian River County. The server was not up to the task of actually waiting on people. The restaurant itself was shockingly dirty, with debris on the floor AND table not bused , the server stations we saw were also dirty with funky stuff. All of this might have been ok had the food been at good. The garbage we were served was not fit for a dog. There were three other tables nearby which were also not happy. One table of three actually took off as our server was no where to be found. I can not say that I blame the other guest for leaving as we were about to do the same when our entrees finally arrived. We too would have complained if only we had had the opportunity to do so. As it was we never did see that particular server the rest of the night. We ended up paying our check (they were lucky) to another server who seemed very put out to have to do this for us. Needless to say we will never return. What is more, it is hard to fathom why so many people have raved about this place. In short, it really sucked!"

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a tasteful Americana motif. There is even a separate party room for larger groups. The food is absolutely terrific. The menu is light-fare and consists of pot pies, quiche, soups, sandwiches and salads. The best part of the dining experience is the desert. There are lots of pies and cakes to choose from for desert, all of them delicious. If you want, you can take home a pie too. The service is great too. The restaurant is co-located with the Flower Bin which provides a neat place to shop for candles, flowers and other interesting items. By far, my favorite place to eat in Missouri."
