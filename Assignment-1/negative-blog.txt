South Korea is a country where I was born. Since elementary, I’ve been moving around from cities to cities. Because of that, I was never able to make memorable friends in school. As this continued, I believed that I am not social and can’t make good friends. There is one time where I got really mad at my friend and used violence against him. I don’t remember why I did that or why I was mad at him. Maybe I knew I made a huge mistake and wanted to forget everything. Since that moment, I knew I will be lonely and the only thing I can forget myself from being lonely is to play video games. Because South Korean parents have high expectation from kids when it comes to schoolwork, my parents had been disappointed in me when I was a child. My parents were never home but when they were, they always ask my grades and how well I am doing in school. Obviously, I wasn’t doing well so I had to lie my parents. My parents also forced me to go two afterschool programs, which were English and Piano afterschool. Neither of them I liked but I had no choice but to go. Because I was forced to go to afterschool, I never had a chance to play with my elementary friends. Because of that, if you ask me if I remember any friend back in South Korea, I will tell you that I don’t remember names or faces. As this continued, my depression as a child was slowly getting bigger. I wished that I had a new life where I can start all over again, have friends, and smile like others.
