Since I was a kid, technology was always my interest and dream. Because of my curiosity, I need to know what’s going behind in all of machines that I touch or play with. Although I am not gifted unlike others who can understand and program better than I do. However, I believe that things will get better in my life if I constantly try hard and challenge myself even further. When I was a high school student, I took this class called ELD, which stands for early learning development. It was a class for students who speak English as their second language. I knew that I was lacking a lot of stuff but I believe that I can enroll into any Universities out there if I try my best. However, things weren’t as easy as I thought. The first thing is that I have to take AP classes. It’s a class where a course covers stuff that are taught in college. By taking these courses, students can challenge themselves and achieve higher GPA. For me, the first thing that came to me was a language barrier. Understanding materials in the book and lecture slides created by teachers were almost impossible to interpret with my English level. When I even told my friends that I was going to take AP classes, they laughed at me and told me that I will fail. However, those negative feedbacks didn’t stop me. I still tried my best and finally were able to go to University of California, Santa Cruz. My effort didn’t stop there. I decided to go for computer science major in second year of my college. Still, that wasn’t enough for me. I also decided to go for double major with Technology and Information management. To conclude, I am here almost graduating with double degrees in 4 years only. Now, I compare myself with other friends who laughed at me back then. I smile knowing that I have better future than my enemies.
